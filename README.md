# License Plate Detection and OCR using YOLO and EasyOCR

This project demonstrates an automated system for detecting vehicles and extracting license plate text from images using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and EasyOCR. The project is designed for applications such as traffic monitoring, automated toll collection, and parking management systems.

# Features

Vehicle Detection: Identifies vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles in an image.
License Plate Detection: Locates license plates within the detected vehicles.
Text Extraction: Uses EasyOCR to extract text from license plates.
Visual Display: Highlights detected vehicles and license plates with bounding boxes and overlays the extracted text.
Customizable Models: Supports custom-trained YOLO models for vehicles and license plates.
